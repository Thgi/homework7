# train-scheduler

This train scheduler website is the first use of a database to store information on the internet. 
The website is designed for users to add more trains to the table. On a local stored site, the tables would not sync properly.
Because the information is stored on Firebase,

In order to access Firebase, you need a Google account. The Firebase link is at the following:

https://firebase.google.com

The website is designed to have a list of different train names, their destinations, their frequency of arrival, 
and their arrival time.

Using Firebase is similar to using other websites that have API's. You need an API key in order to access your database, 
along with your personal Firebase link. This is all set up in a config variable which is used to contact Firebase to confirm
your identity.
